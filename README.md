# Builder-web3-dApp
The purpose of dApp Builder is to bring smart contract technology to the business users who do not necessarily have the technical know-how to create smart contract. dApp Builder allows you to create dApps, customize their frontend and use them both on your desktop and on your mobile device using the dApp Widget.
